Music fan may have a huge amount of physical CDs, LPs, Cassettes. BandurriaJ will allow them to manage their full catalogue,

 The idea? Imagine you have many Cds and you want to organize them. You put it in your PC CD reader an load it into Bandurria. Then, it will ask
 to MusicBrainz for the metadata and complete it, so you have the information about your cd. Then you can save it.
 Finally, you can search in your collection by artist, band name, songs etc!
