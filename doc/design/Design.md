# Design document
This is the design document, where all the design documentation is stored.

The core functionality of BandurriaJ is to create Catalogues of Discs, CDs and Cassettes so a music 
fan can have a centralized place to store it and to retrieve information about it. 

For instance, imagine you have a huge collection of CDs and a friend wants to know if you can borrow him
some Jazz cd from the 70s. You can check in BandurriaJ and see that you have a perfect CDs with 
the label 1002. So you can now check in your collection for the CD #1002 and lend it!.
