Hello! 

If you want to participate in this project we would be happy! You can take a look at the current open issues, there are a few ones dedicated for newcomers in the project. But also, if you're searching for smaller things to do, you can check one of the many Todos that are present in the code. You can then open an issue for one of them and send us a merge request into the development branch.

You can also help us to identify next features to include or suscribe as a beta tester once we'll have a first version.

In order to participate, you can fork the repository and create a pull request with your changes. We accept pull requests to the develop branch.

We are waiting for you!
